* Radiance(WIP)
Operations on target object will affect all same objects.

*NOTE : This package is still a work in progress, some breaking changes may occur.*
* Usage
All commands in this package can be used alone, in which case the matching scope
is the current buffer. When you use =radiance-mark-region= to set several regions,
then the matching scope is marked regions.
