* Radiance(WIP)
Radiance combines kmacro and overlays to make multiple-cursor editing more fluent.

*NOTE : This package is still a work in progress, some breaking changes may occur.*
* Usage
All commands in this package can be used alone, in which case the matching scope
is the current buffer. When you use =radiance-mark-region= to set several regions,
then the matching scope is marked regions.

| =radiance-exit=         | Quit out of recording the macro or delete overlays.                   |
| =radiance-finish=       | Finish defining a keyboard macro and apply the macro to all overlays. |
